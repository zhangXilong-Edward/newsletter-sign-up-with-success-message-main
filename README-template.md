## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript 

### What I learned

1. <button type="button"> and <button type="submit"> should listen to different event listeners. 
- for type button - we can use a click event 
- for type submit - we should use submit event
- one thing to note is that: 
- make sure the click EventListener is attached to the element where the user is expected to click, 
- but the submit EventListener should be attached to the form element that the user is submitting.

2. insert elements after and before: 
- after: 
- [emailLabel].parentNode.insertBefore([errortext], [emailLabel].nextSibling);
- before: 
- parentNode.insertBefore([newNode], [referenceNode]);
- or use 
- [referenceNode].insertAdjacentElement('beforebegin', [newNode]);

3. there is CSS specificity order, when a css style is not working, be sure to check 

4. HTML form has built-in validation, if you use submit event listener, the built-in validation would kick in first!
